# 25.07
What's Changed

New Launcher

The way Anki is packaged and distributed has changed:

  * You can use the launchers below to download the latest Anki version, and update to newer versions/downgrade to
  old ones.
  * You'll find a Tools>Upgrade/Downgrade menu item inside Anki to return the launcher.
  * The oldest supported Anki version to install is 2.1.50.
  * The Mac and Linux launchers support both AMD64 (Intel) and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) machines. The Windows
  installer is AMD64-only, but will run in emulation mode on ARM Windows.
  * On Linux, glibc 2.36 or later is now required.
  * Anki now ships with Python 3.13 (but has not yet bumped the minimum Python from 3.9).
  * The new launcher still has room for improvement.

# 25.02.7-1

  * Fix some add-ons broken by the security update a few days ago (thanks to @tatsumoto-ren)
  * Fix 'record own voice' and TTS breakages (thanks to @abdnh)
  * Silence an "unknown error" message that appears on some devices.

# 25.02.6-1
Another security update. Windows users are strongly recommended to update.

  * Specially-crafted sound file references could cause files to be written to arbitrary locations on Windows. Thanks again to Michael Lappas for his investigation.
  * References to audio files outside of the media folder are no longer allowed.
  * Ensure mpv is tidied up even on a crash, which should fix the mpv errors some people got when updating.

# 25.02.5-1
More security fixes, thanks to some reports by Michael Lappas:

  * Plug a hole that could allow a malicious shared deck on Windows to execute arbitrary commands when playing audio.
  * Links to other apps (eg obsidian://...) will now request permission to open. Thanks to @soleuniverse101 for the UI improvements here.

Also, building of the Docker image for this release should be fixed, thanks to @KolbyML.

# 25.02.4-1
Fixes regressions in the 25.02.1 security update:

  * Use an alternative approach for securing the editor, which should be less disruptive.
  * Improve add-on compatibility (thanks in part to @glutanimate[1] and @iamllama[2]).
  * Don't check collection size when syncing with a custom sync server.

The following add-ons have been reported as currently incompatible:

  * Syntax Highlighting
  * Anki IPA

If you run into issues with other add-ons, please let us know on the forums.

# 25.02.1-1
This is a security-focused update. If you use any shared decks, updating is strongly recommended.

  * The review screen had protections in place to prevent shared decks from accessing other data on your computer, but these proved to be insufficient. A big thank you to Michael Lappas for the report.
  * JavaScript references such as onclick handlers are now stripped from field content when editing it. Most users are unlikely to see a change here, but it may result in breakages if you're using a shared deck that placed such content into individual fields against our recommendations.

One non-security change was also slipped in:

  * If your collection size is over the AnkiWeb limit, you'll now receive a message at the start of the sync, instead of the sync failing later.

# 25.02-1

What's Changed:

Compatibility
The Linux package now requires glibc 2.2 (2019 Ubuntu/Fedora, and 2021 Debian).

New Features
FSRS

FSRS has received significant changes in this release, and should be even more
efficient. It is recommended that you optimize your presets after updating.

To avoid errors on older clients, updated parameters will only be visible to
Anki releases from 24.11 on. Older clients will continue to work, but may
give you different scheduling results when reviews are done on them.

By @L-M-Sherlock in #3298.

Other new features:

  * Add FSRS simulator to deck options by @L-M-Sherlock in #3257
  * Add forgetting curve to card info by @L-M-Sherlock in #3437
  * Let FSRS control short term schedule when no (re)learning steps are set. This is experimental. By @L-M-Sherlock in #3375 and #3505 and #3367
Scheduling
  * Load balancing: within your fuzz range, Anki will now try to pick days that have fewer reviews waiting. By @jakeprobst in #3230.
  * Easy days: you can now tell Anki to try avoid certain days of the week. By @L-M-Sherlock in #3442
  * Decks can now be sorted by descending retrievability. Simulations have shown this is a better choice
  * when you have a backlog, and this sort order is likely to become the default in the future.

Stats/Graphs

  * Add true retention stats by @L-M-Sherlock in #3425
  * Estimated total knowledge by note, and daily load by @L-M-Sherlock in #3507

Other Features

  * Add "open image" option to editor by @user1823 in #3431
  * Add an option to show image from editor in folder by @user1823 in #3412
  * Add card position column and always show position in card info by @taylorobyen in #3471
  * Add option for toggling update checks by @voczi in #3346
  * Add revert to backup option to file menu by @taylorobyen in #3434
  * Empty Cards can now be undone by @Arthur-Milchior in #3386
  * If deck options are modified, ask before closing by @Arthur-Milchior in #3410
  * Integrate AnkiHub Sign-in into the preferences screen by @abdnh in #3232.
  * Support {{type:nc:...}} to ignore combining characters by @twwn in #3422
