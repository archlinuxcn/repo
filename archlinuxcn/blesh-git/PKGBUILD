# The AUR package has been first submitted by capezotte in 2021.  At that time,
# Seto and I (akinomyoga) hepled designing the integration for the automatic
# update of ble.sh installed by an AUR helper.  After capezotte became inactive
# after capezotte switched to another distribution, the package on AUR became
# stale and removed temporarily.  I (akinomyoga) contacted capezotte and took
# over the maintenance of the package in 2022.  The package was re-submitted at
# that time.  In Aug. 2023, willemw has provided us with useful comments about
# PKGBUILD.

# If available, ble.sh chooses gawk/nawk/mawk depending on the operation with
# awk based on the speed.  Each awk implementation has specific cases where it
# performs better than any other implementation, so ble.sh tries to select the
# fastest implementation, if possible, for each operation with awk.
