# Repeated `github` keys are not by a mistake!
# During the 0.6.0 release period, upstream pushes the commit for 0.6.0
# first [1], and then the 0.6.0 tag. Lilac builds for that commit and creates
# lxqt-build-tools-git 0.5.0.20.g3934e9c (the 0.6.0 tag is not there at that
# time).  After the tag is pushed Lilac should rebuild that package as
# 0.6.0 (same commit, different versions due to different nearest tag), hence
# the second `github` key.
