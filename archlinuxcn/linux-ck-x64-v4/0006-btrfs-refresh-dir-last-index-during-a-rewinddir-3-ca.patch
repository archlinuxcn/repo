Subject: [PATCH 06/12] btrfs: refresh dir last index during a rewinddir(3)
 call

When opening a directory we find what's the index of its last entry and
then store it in the directory's file handle private data (struct
btrfs_file_private::last_index), so that in the case new directory entries
are added to a directory after an opendir(3) call we don't end up in an
infinite loop (see commit 9b378f6ad48c ("btrfs: fix infinite directory
reads")) when calling readdir(3).

However once rewinddir(3) is called, POSIX states [1] that any new
directory entries added after the previous opendir(3) call, must be
returned by subsequent calls to readdir(3):

  "The rewinddir() function shall reset the position of the directory
   stream to which dirp refers to the beginning of the directory.
   It shall also cause the directory stream to refer to the current
   state of the corresponding directory, as a call to opendir() would
   have done."

We currently don't refresh the last_index field of the struct
btrfs_file_private associated to the directory, so after a rewinddir(3)
we are not returning any new entries added after the opendir(3) call.

Fix this by finding the current last index of the directory when llseek
is called agains the directory.

This can be reproduced by the following C program provided by Ian Johnson:

   #include <dirent.h>
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main(void) {
     DIR *dir = opendir("test");

     FILE *file;
     file = fopen("test/1", "w");
     fwrite("1", 1, 1, file);
     fclose(file);

     file = fopen("test/2", "w");
     fwrite("2", 1, 1, file);
     fclose(file);

     rewinddir(dir);

     struct dirent *entry;
     while ((entry = readdir(dir))) {
        printf("%s\n", entry->d_name);
     }
     closedir(dir);
     return 0;
   }
