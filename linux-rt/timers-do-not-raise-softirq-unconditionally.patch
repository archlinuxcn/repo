well, that very same problem is in mainline if you add "threadirqs" to
the command line. But we can be smart about this. The untested patch
below should address that issue. If that works on mainline we can
adapt it for RT (needs a trylock(&base->lock) there).

Though it's not a full solution. It needs some thought versus the
softirq code of timers. Assume we have only one timer queued 1000
ticks into the future. So this change will cause the timer softirq not
to be called until that timer expires and then the timer softirq is
going to do 1000 loops until it catches up with jiffies. That's
anything but pretty ...

What worries me more is this one:

  pert-5229  [003] d..h1..   684.482618: softirq_raise: vec=9 [action=RCU]

The CPU has no callbacks as you shoved them over to cpu 0, so why is
the RCU softirq raised?

Thanks,

	tglx
