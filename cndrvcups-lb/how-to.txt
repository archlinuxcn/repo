Installation:
1) Make sure CUPS is running and your printer is turned on and connected to your computer.
    eg.
    systemctl start cups

2) Check the name of the device, udev created for you.
    eg. /dev/usb/lp0

3) /usr/sbin/lpadmin -p [Printer Name] -m [PPD file] -v usb:[device file location] -E
    eg.
    /usr/sbin/lpadmin -p LBP2900 -m CNCUPSLBP2900CAPTK.ppd -v usb:/dev/usblp0 -E 
    you can find ppds in the /usr/share/cups/model/ directory)
    
6) Now you can print. If desired use "systemctl enable cups" to have it start automatically on boot
