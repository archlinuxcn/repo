Subject: [PATCH] [CMake] Fix pthread handling for out-of-tree builds

LLVM defines `PTHREAD_LIB` which is used by AddLLVM.cmake and various projects
to correctly link the threading library when needed. Unfortunately
`PTHREAD_LIB` is defined by LLVM's `config-ix.cmake` file which isn't installed
and therefore can't be used when configuring out-of-tree builds. This causes
such builds to fail since `pthread` isn't being correctly linked.

This patch attempts to fix that problem by renaming and exporting
`LLVM_PTHREAD_LIB` as part of`LLVMConfig.cmake`. I renamed `PTHREAD_LIB`
because It seemed likely to cause collisions with downstream users of
`LLVMConfig.cmake`.
