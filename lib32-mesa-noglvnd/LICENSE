Disclaimer

Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to
that of OpenGL*
To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command syntax or state
machine, it is being used with authorization from Silicon Graphics,
Inc.(SGI). However, the author does not possess an OpenGL license
from SGI, and makes no claim that Mesa is in any way a compatible
replacement for OpenGL or associated with SGI. Those who want a
licensed implementation of OpenGL should contact a licensed
vendor.

Please do not refer to the library as MesaGL (for legal
reasons). It's just Mesa or The Mesa 3-D graphics
library

* OpenGL is a trademark of Silicon Graphics Incorporated.
